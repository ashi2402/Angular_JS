    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>The study of intelligence began in Paris in the late 1890s with Alfred Binet, who developed a test designed
        to identify children with special educational needs.His approach of quantifying intelligence was then
        readily accepted in the United States and worldwide. Schools began testing children and adopting curricula
        that would help students improve their IQs.</p>

    <p>In the 1970s, Howard Gardner, at Harvard University, started questioning the traditional definition of
        intelligence on which such tests were based. He worked with talented children and adults who had brain
        damage. He found that people had many other gifts and talents that weren't necessarily reflected in the
        traditional ideals of intelligence. He used a variety of sources – including neurophysiology research and
        studies with autistic people, geniuses, and proteges – to support his model that various parts of the brain
        provide different types of intelligence.</p>

    <p>The original Multiple Intelligence theory was developed in 1983 and first published in his book, ‘Frames of
        Mind.’ The book strongly suggests that everybody has a different mind, and no two profiles of intelligence
        are the same. Therefore, the traditional concept of measuring intelligence by I.Q testing is far too
        restricted. From the 8 primary intelligences, an individual may excel in one, two or even three of these,
        but nobody’s good at them all. </p>
