                <p>Dermatoglyphics is an integration of neuroscience, medicine, genetics, psychology and behavioral science and
                    it is based on the formation and the amount of ridges present on the finger prints. Medical science has
                    already confirmed that during the growth of the foetus within the mother’s womb from the 13th – 19th week,
                    fingerprints are formed simultaneously with the development of the neocortex. They begin to develop in the
                    embryo in the 13th week, and are formed by the 24th week.It is closely related to the infant’s brain
                    development. The distribution of prints is considered to represent brain cells’ proportion and distribution
                    in each of the brain lobes.Through research, geneticists have proven that dermatoglyph formations are
                    controlled by chromosomes, and the patterns are influenced by polygenetic inheritance. </p>

                <p>Human brain has two parts (Left Brain & right Brain) and each part consists of five lobes. These ten lobes
                    have different functionalities and these lobes are correlated with fingerprints of both hands. the hands are
                    sources of physiological and psychological information waiting to be tapped, hence the increasing importance
                    in the field of dermatoglyphics.IT is closely related to the infant’s brain development. The distribution of
                    prints is considered to represent brain cells’ proportion and distribution in each of the brain lobes.</p>
